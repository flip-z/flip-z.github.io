    <h3>Watership Down / Richard Adams / Audio (Peter Capaldi)</h3>
    <p>
      I tried for the last few months to get back into audio books during car rides and dog walks, and was struggling to focus on some modern popular titles.
      <br><br>
      Ray Porter's reading of <b>Project Hail Mary</b> by Andy Weir was a dissapointingly annoying science lesson compared to <b>The Martian</b> which I loved. Some friends crushed Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive (~300 hours of listening) in just a few weeks, and I just found it boring as hell.
      <br><br>
      After putting both of those down after a few hours, Watership Down sucked me in with the simple adventure of wild rabbits escaping destruction. Obviously pulling from core epics like <b>The Hobbit</b> and <b>The Odyssey</b>, I held my breath at every challenge Hazel and the gang encountered.
      <br><br>
      For a bunch of rabbits, the characters are all well developed with unique qualities, and Peter Capaldi does an awesome job differentiating their accents and demeanors, making them all feel like unique contributors to the adventure.
      <br><br>
      The way we, as readers, get to learn about the world along with the cast reminded me strongly of <b>Avatar: The Last Airbender</b>, and I received it just as well. Their culture, language, love of stories, and distinctly non-human perspectives kept me engaged with every one of their struggles. By the end of the story, I found myself emotional at everything they'd been through, and inspired by the courage of rabbits.
