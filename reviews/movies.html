    <h1>Movies</h1>
    <h3>Babylon - Damien Chazelle</h3>
    <p>
      Ok I'm a huge fan of Damien Chazelle. Loved <b>Whiplash</b> and <b>La La Land</b>. <b>First Man</b> was pretty cool as well. This one was really really not for me. Felt a lot like he turned the art and hollywood focus up way past my viewing altitude. There were a number of really cool scenes and sequences, and I really <i>wanted</i> to like it at times, but when the credits rolled I really was just unsure why I hadn't turned it off earlier.
      <br><br>
      I'm hoping his next movie departs strongly from the <i>theater kids basking in the glow of their own  cleverness and self awareness</i> energy that now all three of his writer/director movies have reveled in. It was a common criticism, if I remember correctly, of La La Land that I didn't quite agree with. Babylon is on a whole other level, and that level sucks.

    <h3>Lightning Round</h3>
    <li><b>La La Land ⭐</b> - Love thoughtful endings, love the colors, love the music.</li>
    <li><b>Whiplash ⭐</b> - Same director, even better. Perfect ending.</li>
    <li><b>Sicario</b> - Imperfect, but some really intense 10/10 scenes. Ending not as good</li>
    <li><b>Spotlight</b> - Long slow burn, but all star cast does a ton of work</li>
    <li><b>The Lobster</b> - I don't love everything this guy does, but what a funky weird time</li>
    <li><b>No Country For Old Men ⭐</b> - Been a while, but this was one of my all time favorites.</li>
    <li><b>Nightcrawler</b> - Messed up in all the right ways. Good rewatch once in a while.</li>
    <li><b>District 9</b> - Would've expected this to inspire a bunch of copycats. Extremely unique.</li>
    <li><b>American Beauty</b> - Honestly forget this one entirely. Need to rewatch</li>
    <li><b>Prisoners</b> - Slower burn, but worth the payoff. I guess I like Jake in anything...</li>
    <li><b>The LEGO Movie</b> - A great time start to finish.</li>
    <li><b>Hell or High Water ⭐</b> - If you've got a brother you should watch this. Big favorite.</li>
    <li><b>Get Out</b> - Don't usually like horror but this deserved all the praise.</li>
    <li><b>Baby Driver</b> - Flubbed the ending but otherwise awesome.</li>
    <li><b>The Nice Guys ⭐</b> - Shocked this didn't do better. Near perfect buddy cop.</li>
    <li><b>Logan</b> - Standout superhero movie. The best one and it's not close.</li>
    <li><b>The Place Beyond the Pines</b> - Maybe controversial inclusion. Interesting and awkward</li>
    <li><b>The Big Short</b> - A classic. Like slightly less on rewatch but tons of great moments.</li>
    <li><b>Sing Street</b> - Fun time, music stuck in my head for a while.</li>
    <li><b>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri ⭐</b> - An actual perfect movie</li>
    <li><b>Annihilation</b> - Some problems, but a really interesting way to tell a story. Don't read the books.</li>
    <li><b>Wind River</b> - Really tense, quite uncomfortable</li>
    <li><b>Dunkirk</b> - I loved this and so did everyone but honestly a bit forgettable?</li>
    <li><b>Chef ⭐</b> - Wholseome happy awesome</li>
    <li><b>Joker</b> - Like Logan, love the character focused standalones (pretending Joker 2 doesn't exist)</li>
    <li><b>Top Gun: Maverick ⭐</b> - Couldn't get through the original. Almost joined the military.</li>
