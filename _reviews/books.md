#### **Born to Run \| Christopher McDougall ⭐⭐⭐** 
Quality, slightly rambly story. Shined in the margins with legendary ultra runner profiles.
#### **Carmilla \| Sheridan Le Fanu ⭐⭐⭐**
1872 writing difficult in audiobook format. Good trip back to vampire origins.
#### **Project Hail Mary \| Andy Weir ⭐**
Worst book I remember finishing. Cringey protagonist holding incredible story hostage.
#### **Watership Down \| Richard Adams ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**
Impressively engaging rabbit epic. Called me back to wonder of **The Hobbit**.

### Lightning Round

- **Ordinary Men \| Christopher R. Browning** - Horrific and sobering account of a reserve battalion in WWII.
- **A Year and a Day on Just a Few Acres \| Pete Larson** - [Pete's](https://www.youtube.com/c/JustaFewAcresFarm) self-published journey to full time farming.
- **The Snowman \| Jo Nesbø** - One of the only books I was ever really unable to put down.
- **Cold Storage \| David Koepp** - Read this on a single flight, pretty fun.
- **Greenlights \| Matthew McConaughey** - Funny, inspiring, amazing overall
- **Dracula \| Bram Stoker** - Read this via an email [newsletter](https://draculadaily.substack.com/). Epic, and actually scary at times.
- **Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hide \| Robert Louis Stevenson** - Not at all what I expected
