### Babylon - Damien Chazelle

Ok I'm a huge fan of Damien Chazelle. Loved **Whiplash** and **La La Land**. **First Man** was pretty cool as well. This one was really really not for me. Felt a lot like he turned the art and hollywood focus up way past my viewing altitude. There were a number of really cool scenes and sequences, and I really *wanted* to like it at times, but when the credits rolled I really was just unsure why I hadn't turned it off earlier.

I'm hoping his next movie departs strongly from the *theater kids basking in the glow of their own cleverness and self awareness* energy that now all three of his writer/director movies have reveled in. It was a common criticism, if I remember correctly, of La La Land that I didn't quite agree with. Babylon is on a whole other level, and that level sucks.

### Lightning Round

- **La La Land ⭐** - Love thoughtful endings, love the colors, love the music.
- **Whiplash ⭐** - Same director, even better. Perfect ending.
- **Sicario** - Imperfect, but some really intense 10/10 scenes. Ending not as good
- **Spotlight** - Long slow burn, but all star cast does a ton of work
- **The Lobster** - I don't love everything this guy does, but what a funky weird time
- **No Country For Old Men ⭐** - Been a while, but this was one of my all time favorites.
- **Nightcrawler** - Messed up in all the right ways. Good rewatch once in a while.
- **District 9** - Would've expected this to inspire a bunch of copycats. Extremely unique.
- **American Beauty** - Honestly forget this one entirely. Need to rewatch
- **Prisoners** - Slower burn, but worth the payoff. I guess I like Jake in anything...
- **The LEGO Movie** - A great time start to finish.
- **Hell or High Water ⭐** - If you've got a brother you should watch this. Big favorite.
- **Get Out** - Don't usually like horror but this deserved all the praise.
- **Baby Driver** - Flubbed the ending but otherwise awesome.
- **The Nice Guys ⭐** - Shocked this didn't do better. Near perfect buddy cop.
- **Logan** - Standout superhero movie. The best one and it's not close.
- **The Place Beyond the Pines** - Maybe controversial inclusion. Interesting and awkward
- **The Big Short** - A classic. Like slightly less on rewatch but tons of great moments.
- **Sing Street** - Fun time, music stuck in my head for a while.
- **Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri ⭐** - An actual perfect movie
- **Annihilation** - Some problems, but a really interesting way to tell a story. Don't read the books.
- **Wind River** - Really tense, quite uncomfortable
- **Dunkirk** - I loved this and so did everyone but honestly a bit forgettable?
- **Chef ⭐** - Wholesome happy awesome
- **Joker** - Like Logan, love the character focused standalones (pretending Joker 2 doesn't exist)
- **Top Gun: Maverick ⭐** - Couldn't get through the original. Almost joined the military.
