    <h1>Self Storage</h1>
    <a href="https://storeganise.com/blog/self-storage-trends">Resource1</a>
    <p>Self-storage is a business that’s all too common and all too unnecessary. It’s a low-effort, dependable profit model, taking up valuable real estate to warehouse belongings that most people will likely never use again. These buildings are eyesores, falling into a utilitarian architectural style that prioritizes cheap functionality over any consideration for design or community fit. Built to be efficient, they lack windows, greenery, and visual appeal, giving neighborhoods a lifeless, industrial look.
      <br><br>
      The numbers tell the story. The self-storage industry in the U.S. alone spans over 2.1 billion square feet, with occupancy rates around 85%, bringing in over $23 billion annually. With around 24% of units rented for over two years, it’s clear this isn’t just a convenience during a move—it’s become long-term housing for things people can’t bring themselves to part with. Paying monthly for storage is almost like signing up for a subscription to keep items you may never need, a strange commitment to avoiding decisions about what’s worth keeping.
      
      Self-storage may have a role during big life events, like moving, downsizing, or a family transition. But it shouldn’t be everywhere. For the person with a few boxes, there are simpler solutions, like asking a friend for temporary storage. This trend doesn’t really address a lack of space; it just perpetuates ownership of items long past their usefulness, costing people money and mental space.

      These facilities occupy land that could be so much more. They sit on valuable plots that could hold businesses, housing, or community spaces that enrich the area. Instead, self-storage thrives as a low-effort solution to a self-imposed problem, profiting from the decision to stash things out of sight and out of mind.Self-storage is a business that’s all too common and all too unnecessary.
