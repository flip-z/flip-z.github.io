title: "Instant Coffee"
---

Before last year my caffeination was limited to sipping heinous seasonal flavors of red bull on cross country drives. I can only handle so much caffeine without vibrating out of my skin.

But now with a job that demands more from me, a house to maintain, and a child on the way I've allowed myself a single, slowly consumed, cup of coffee each morning. I've tried a few of the internet's favorite methods for beginners without lofty standards: Keuring, french press, instant...

Instant Coffee is the bees knees!

Pros:
- No cleanup. One dirty spoon used to scoop and stir
- No burning my face. Doesn't even need to be heated to a boil to brew. Optimal temp every time.
- No special equipment. Just me and my powder.

I will entertain arguments, but they make some tasty enough options now so good luck.
